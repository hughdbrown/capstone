24 Mar 2015 Germanwings flight 9525 crashed in the French Alps, killing all 150 aboard.
Global interest in the story was high from the start but the progress of the story (with the gradual revelation
of the copilot's suicide) captured the world's interest over several days. Breaking news on the story caused
spikes in internet traffic over this period.

Examination of the global interest cannot be captured from a single website. Instead, data from bit.ly's url
shortening service serves as a proxy for the global activity.

This presentation covers the internet story, as revealed by topic modeling on bit.ly decode data.

First, the data:
- bit.ly provided me with short url decodes of the first 10 minutes of each of 72 hours
- each of the 9187392 JSON documents represents a single hit of a bit.ly shortened url
- 15 000 pages represented documents found to have relevance to the Germanwings story
- document content was extracted by screen scraping
        
Here are the topics present in the 15 000 Germanwings documents, according to non-negative matrix factorization:

But countries' interest in the story was not represented by equal interest in the topics.
Here are how countries' interest as represented in each topic:

But in addition, interest in the topics changed over time, as we would expect with a story in which details emerged gradually:

Technical notes

NMF + wordclouds 
Ordinarily, topic modeling weights words by the frequency of word occurrence in a document, assuming that all documents have equal importance.
Documents in my model were weighted according to their number of hits for that document, to reflect their varying importance.

Tools
- pandas/numpy
- mongodb/AWS

-----

Complications
- cleaning data of HTML artifacts
    - so many different layouts means inability to scrape uniformly
- different languages
- documents that do not accurately describe their content (i.e. streaming video)
- pages that retired content over 6 month period
